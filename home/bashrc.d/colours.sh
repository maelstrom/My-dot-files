# Environment variables for colours for programs.
# This script should be kept dumb, as other programs will parse it to extract
# the variables. Just use `export NAME="VALUE"`, and that is it.
#
# The colours are generally used as 'FILL', 'INACTIVE', and 'ACTIVE', all with
# black text.

# tmux colours
export TMUX_FILL="053"
export TMUX_INACTIVE="125"
export TMUX_ACTIVE="219"

# vim colours
export VIM_FILL="17"
export VIM_INACTIVE="27"
export VIM_ACTIVE="117"
